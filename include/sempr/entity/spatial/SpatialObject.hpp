    This class represents a generic spatial object with no exactly known semantic type. Instead,
    it contains a list of possible types and a confidence value for each of them. The type with
    the highest confidence is assumed to be true and presented via RDF statements.
    It can store a variety of key/values by using an RDFPropertyMap and has a pointer to a generic
    geometry-entity that can be used to store a geometry that represents it.

    TODO: Having a generic geometry is a bit tricky. Who should own it? What happens on removal? What happens when a new one is assigned? For know, I'll just give it a GeometryCollection that cannot be replaced. But of course you can modify the OGRGeometryCollection directly and feed it different stuff.
